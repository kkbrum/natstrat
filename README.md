Natural strata can be used in observational studies to balance the
distributions of many covariates across any number of treatment groups
and any number of comparisons. These strata have proportional amounts of
units within each stratum across the treatments, allowing for simple
interpretation and aggregation across strata. Within each stratum, the
units are chosen using randomized rounding of a linear program that
balances many covariates.
