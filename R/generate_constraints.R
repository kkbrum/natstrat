#' Generate constraints to encourage covariate balance
#'
#' This function generates constraints that encourage covariate balance as specified.
#' The main inputs are formula like objects, where the left hand side indicates
#' the covariate to be balanced and the right hand side indicates the
#' groups within which to balance. The constraints are
#' weighted and standardized by \code{\link{stand}()} to be used in \code{\link{optimize_controls}()}. Missingness
#' indicators can also be added and weighted for any covariate that has \code{NA} values.
#'
#' @inheritParams stand
#' @inheritParams parse_formula
#' @param balance_formulas a list of formulas where the left hand side represents
#'   the covariate to be balanced, and the terms on the right hand side represent
#'   the groups within which the covariate should be balanced. More information can
#'   be found in the details below.
#' @param weight_by_size numeric between 0 and 1 stating how to adjust constraints
#'   for the size of the groups they represent. Default is 0, meaning imbalance
#'   within groups is viewed in absolute terms, not relative to the group size.
#'   The program may thus prioritize
#'   balancing the covariate in larger groups compared to smaller groups. A value
#'   of 1 means that imbalance will be measured relative to the group's size, not
#'   in absolute terms, implying that it is equally important to balance in every group.
#' @param autogen_missing whether to automatically generate missingness constraints
#'   and how heavily to prioritize them. Should be a numeric
#'   or \code{NULL}. \code{NULL} indicates that
#'   constraints to balance the rate of missingness (denoted by \code{NA}s
#'   in \code{data}) should not be automatically generated. Note that this is not
#'   recommended unless the user has already accounted for missing values.
#'   If not \code{NULL}, \code{autogen_missing} should be a numeric stating how heavily
#'   to prioritize generated missingness constraints over covariate constraints.
#'   The default is 50.
#' @return A list with two named components:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{X}}{a matrix with constraints as columns and the same number of rows as the inputs.
#'   The column names provide information about the constraints, including the covariate
#'   names and the factor and level to which it pertains.}
#'   \item{\code{importances}}{a named vector with names corresponding to the constraint names
#'   and values corresponding to how heavily that constraint should be prioritized,
#'   based on the information provided through \code{balance_formulas}, \code{weight_by_size},
#'   and \code{autogen_missing}.}
#'   }

#' @section Details:
#'   The \code{balance_formulas} argument can include formulas beyond those interpreted
#'   by \code{R} to be \code{formulas}. Their interpretation is also different, as
#'   explained below:
#'
#' \describe{
#' \item{Left hand side}{The left hand side of the formula contains the covariate
#'   to be balanced. It can also be the sum of multiple covariates, in which case
#'   each term will be balanced individually according to the right hand side. Additionally,
#'   '.' on the left hand side will designate that all covariates in \code{data}
#'   should be balanced according to the designated or default right hand side
#'   (as usual, terms may be subtracted to remove them).}
#' \item{Right hand side}{The right hand side should be the sum of factor, character,
#'   or boolean variables. The covariate of the left hand side will be balanced within
#'   each level of each term on the right hand side. The right hand side can also
#'   contain '.', meaning the covariate will be balanced across all levels of all
#'   categorical, character, or boolean variables found in \code{data} (as usual,
#'   terms may be subtracted to remove them). In the most common case, the user
#'   will have one term on the right hand side consisting of the strata within
#'   which balance in desired.}
#' \item{Coefficients}{The formulas can contain coefficients specifying how much
#'   to weight a certain set of constraints. Coefficients of the left hand side terms will
#'   weight all constraints generated for that covariate, and coefficients of the
#'   right hand side will weight the constraints generated for each level of that
#'   term.}
#' \item{Intercept}{The intercept term, 1, is automatically included on the right
#'   hand side of the formula, and designates that the covariate of the left hand side
#'   will be balanced across all control units. You may enter a different numeric > 0
#'   that will signify how much to weight the constraint, or you may enter "- 1" or "+ 0"
#'   to remove the intercept and its associated constraint, as per usual.}}
