The goal of natstrat is to obtain unweighted natural strata that balance many covariates.
Natural strata fix a constant ratio of controls to treated units within 
each stratum. This ratio need not be an integer. The control units are 
chosen using randomized rounding of a linear program that balances many 
covariates.
