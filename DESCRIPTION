Title: Obtain Unweighted Natural Strata that Balance Many Covariates

Description: Natural strata fix a constant ratio of controls to treated units within 
    each stratum. This ratio need not be an integer. The control units are 
    chosen using randomized rounding of a linear program that balances many 
    covariates.
    To solve the linear program, the 'Gurobi' commercial optimization software 
    is recommended, but not required. The 'gurobi' R package can be installed following the instructions 
    at <https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/9.1/refman/ins_the_r_package.html>.
